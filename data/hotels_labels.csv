"Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!","5"
"Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.","5"
"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again.","5"

"I stayed here with my family for my daughters wedding. It had a very accommodating staff, Olivia was excellent. The rooms were very well maintained. Would highly recommend this hotel, especially if your wedding venue is Celebrations at the Bay!","5"
"Beautiful rooms and the nicest people working there. The front desk lady, Olivia, was extremely patient and helpful. We had lots of questions and she had just as many answers. The rooms were sleek and modern. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be free breakfast, but I really am asking for a lot. A++ stay. Thank... More","5"
"We stayed here while visiting Maryland Live!. Cute hotel in a great location. Clean, with a very modern look, upgraded bathrooms and amenities and super nice staff. Would definitely recommend and stay there again!","5"
"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More","5"
"In my line of work, I use meeting space in hotels often. In my 15+ years of doing this work, this is the first time I've felt the undeniable pull to go out and write a hotel review, based solely on my meeting room experience. Though I did not use a guest room here, my colleagues who did shared that... More","5"
"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More","5"
"Very friendly staff, great free breakfast items each morning, room and facilities very clean, staff superb! We had a problem with the heating system in our room and they had someone fix it within minutes! Would highly recommend this location/hotel.","5"
"Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly. The room was clean including details, I'm talking no dust,no hair in bathroom-shower or beds which I tend to find in other hotels. Kudos to housekeeping. Sheets were crisp,beds were comfortable especially since this is a newer hotel. Breakfast in... More","5"
"This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.","5"
"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!","5"
"Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.","5"
"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.... More","5"
"Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!","5"
"I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.","5"
"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.","5"
"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!","5"
"After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me this... More","1"
"We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More","1"
"Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future","5"
"Even though we were having problems, i.e. Feather allergy, Flat tire, key not working...the front desk personell were always gracious and helpful.","5"
"It was a great stay","5"
"Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location","5"
"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service.","5"
"The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..","5"
"I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars","5"
"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)....","5"
"Convenient and comfortable. Staff is great, breakfast and WiFi is a bonus.","5"
"Awesome, Overall","5"
"Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference.","5"
"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!","5"
"Repeat trip to this hotel for national conference attendance. Provides a quality stay, business center kept me in touch and great value for limited travel budget.","5"
"I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!","5"
"Our room was a bit small. There was no microwave in the room. Location was more for couples than for family. The room itself And service were excellent.","5"
"This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel.","5"
"Hampton Inn never disappoints. Always an affordable, clean hotel with attentive and friendly staff. The breakfast is always a plus too. Also, the National Harbor is a nice area full of shops and dining choices and seems to be a family friendly hangout destination for locals.","5"
"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great.","5"
"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.","5"
"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent. Our conference managers were a gem, great service! Thank you for making an important event run so smoothly.","5"
"We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable. The hotel offers great rooms, amenities and activities for all ages. I fell and fractured my hand on the last day of our stay (off property) and the... More","5"
"We arrived here very tired after 24 hours of travel and airports and from the moment we arrived we felt like royalty. We dined a Amaya multiple times (please see separate review). The room was stunning and more than we could ever expect, nothing was to little for the staff and they all seemed genuinely friendly even down to the... More","5"
"Stayed here for Thanksgiving and had the best experience. Before we arrived they asked my three year old little boy's name and when we arrived they had the most adorable kids travel pillow and personalized cookie waiting for him. They had children's games on the lawn right outside our bottom floor room, 105, and he had his face painted for... More","5"
"This exquisite property located in the penasquitos canyon of North County is a spectacular retreat. In a setting resembling a Mediterranean villa, the hotel is truly grand, with spacious rooms, several dining options and cozy sitting areas to relax and soak up the well appointed spaces and beautifully manicured grounds. The resort amenities include golf, tennis, heated pools and a... More","5"
"Five of the last six years, our company has hosted our annual meeting at the Grand Del Mar (and we regret not having it six out of six years). The GdM may be the top place to stay in the US, thus my recommendation is in the title of the review. The GdM is not inexpensive, but it is worth... More","5"
"This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready! The next day we had spa appts and the receptionist heard it was our honeymoon trip so after our massages we... More","5"
"The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places.","5"
"Expensive Yes. Service Above the norm! Nickel and dime you on the small stuff Nope! (one of my pet peeves if you are going to stay at a hotel of this caliber) This property gives you 5 star service. Forgot your work out clothes Let the staff know your size. Need some feminine products, be there in 5 minutes. The... More","5"
"If you don't mind staying out of town, the Fairmont Grand Del Mar is a top quality choice for San Diego located about 25 minutes north of the airport. It is a large traditional colonial property, with a beautiful golf course on the west side of the grounds, ample parking, equestrian facilities and a good spa (which has the best... More","5"
"This property is absolutely pristine. The grounds are perfectly maintained, the rooms are luxurious with exquisite detail and the hotel in general is just a site to see. The location is great if you want to be away from the city and in a quiet area with gorgeous views of the hills (but close enough to to drive to Del... More","5"
"I love The Grand Del Mar in Del Mar California. This might have been my 6th time there. It is the only hotel in the area that i will stay at. It is truly a 5 star property. The staff is professional and very attentive. The rooms are very spacious, with marble bathrooms and separate shower and soaking tub. The... More","5"
"We had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont! This is an excellent hotel, with great attention to detail including hotel grounds, architecture, amenities and staff. Service is first class and natural, you are made to feel very welcome. Great looking golf course, and plenty of other activities to enjoy such as walking, the pool, tennis. Or just relax in the... More","5"
"To date, this takes the prize. It did not overwhelm me but I was, over the four days I stayed, consistently well served and impressed at the degree of detail that was maintained in every aspect of the experience. In the same way that the hotel service was a consistently delivered, high degree of service, without being over the top,... More","5"

"We Had the best time ever! r r What a ball we had at Clarion Resort Waterpark! r r The place was large enough to have plenty of rides but small enough to walk comfortably. r r The entire facility is NEW and all the rooms are well","5"
"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need.","5"
"Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel.","5"
"Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.","5"
"Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made! And we were there for the historic parade to celebrate the Chicago Cubs World Series win and the icing on the cake was another historic win - Ireland beating the All Blacks after 111 years!","5"
"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!","5"
"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!","5"
"Good: The suite was very well apointed, plenty of room for an inroom breakfast --the bed and bedding were very nice. The staff couldnt be nicer We had a great night on the rooftop deck.... we never left the propertysmall plates a DJ and wonderful views. Ill be back","5"
"Bad: The view. Good: Everything","5"
"Beds were very comfortable, room amenities perfect. Enjoyed the lobby level coffee shop, roof top bar and happy hour on the 2nd level every evening. A great bonus!","5"
"Good: Beautiful rooms and amenities - L'occitane products. The restaurant Finch great food and amazing bar. Loved the Boxer","5"
"Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.","5"
"Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful.","5"
"Good: The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the room,staff and location were all perfect- thank you The Boxer second time staying with you and all requirements were met.","5"
"The location","5"
"Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden","5"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!","5"
"Good: Very quaint hotel, good location, great staff...amazing time!","5"
"Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.","5"
"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston.","5"
"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food.","5"
"Good: A marvelous location, very friendly crew, it's clear hotel where you feel you are in Boston!","5"
"the bed was very comfortable","5"
"Good: Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.","5"
"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town.","5"
"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return.","5"
"Nice hotel with a great restaurant! Only thing that would have been nice to have it a bathtub rather than just a shower.","5"
"Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby","5"
"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.","5"
"Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food","5"
"Good: Best gambling in Vegas and best comps! Brewery is great, rooms very clean, staff is wonderful. I only stay at Main Street.","5"
"Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!","5"
"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees.","5"
"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance.","5"
"Bad: Very satisfied.","5"
"Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb","5"
"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!","5"
"Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay","5"
"Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient.","5"
"Bad: I loved everything. The parking, the restaurant ,the rooms and the the several acts that perform every night in the downtown area. Good: The people at the front desk were superb. They upgraded me to a real nice room.","5"
"Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep.","5"
"Bad: Better meal choices. Pool and fitness center on property. Good: Ease of conveniece to everything I needed","5"
"Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service","5"
"Bad: The bar tender in the Casino was not at all friendly or attentive. Good: very nice restored hotel. Excellent condition. Great atmosphere. A very nice place to stay in Downtown Las Vegas","5"
"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!","5"
"Bad: good. Good: yes","5"
"Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower.","5"
"Bad: No self parking.. had to reach down to flush toilet. Good: Location","5"
"Bad: We liked everything. Good: The beds were comfortable the rooms were clean","5"
"Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most","5"
"Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view","5"
"Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable.","5"
"Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!","5"
"Good: Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast, nice to have a lounge to sit and read the newspapers provided. Stored luggage until we were ready to leave. Would stay again.","5"
"Bad: parking. Good: BREAKFAST AND THE BAR WERE REAL NICE........BARTENDER chris ..great guy","5"
"Good: Location is fabulous. Got there very early and was able to check in! Room was clean and modern. Love this hotel!","5"
"Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again.","5"
"Bad: Highly recommend. Good: Modern style, great location, super helpful staff, continental breakfast included, great value, clean","5"
"Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff","5"
"Good: great location breakfast","5"
"I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet","5"
"Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet","5"
"Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.","5"
"Bad: breakfast is normal. Good: I am very satisfied this hotel.","5"
"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future","5"
"Good: Bar had a good atmosphere, room was really cute.","5"
"Bad: The pillows were flat. Good: It was a great location close to everything. The bathroom was newly remodeled and beautiful! The bed was average but I got good night's sleep.","5"
"Good: Loved the sound system in the room and the fact that they have coffee all the time!","5"
"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location.","5"
"Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!","5"
"Everything was perfect","5"
"Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.","5"
"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!","5"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors.","5"
"Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable.","5"
"Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.","5"
"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.","5"
"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours.","5"
"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind","5"
"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.","5"
"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.","5"
"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!","5"
"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.","5"
"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.","5"
"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.","5"
"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!","5"
"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!","5"
"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!","5"
"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT","5"
"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.","5"
"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!","5"
"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area.","5"
"I have stayed at the hotel several times over many years (while it was The Carlton). I am SO Very excited about this hotel for so many reasons. While I know there has been some challenges with renovations, I wish people would not get hung...More","5"
"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.","5"
"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!","5"
"Bad: The mini bars are basic. I mean... if that's the only thing I can think of ...then this place is amazing. Good: Everything was perfect. Friendly staff, wonderful location, and they even had a whole setup with lounges on the beach that I was unaware of that was just perfect, too.","5"
"Good: From the room, to the staff to the location.....this hotel has it all... and who doesnt like breakfast that is served until noon....i was a little worried at first, because i couldnt believe the deal we got for a hotel in SoBe....but everything was just PERFECT....","5"
"Good: Courtesy, friendliness of employees. Perfect location.","5"
"Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach.","5"
"Good: Staff and service was very friendly and helpfull. Hotel is nice, location is nice.","5"
"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows.","5"
"Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!","5"
"Bad: the only thing i found not 100 great was the low water pressure in the shower. Good: i love everything about the hotel really. it's just 2 blocks off the beaten track in a very quiet, ye central area of south beach. came during art basel so prices were of course high, but still reasonable","5"
"Good: Room was lovely, shower was great, staff were friendly and very helpful. Bed was comfortable and the room was really quiet","5"
"Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!","5"
"Good: I really liked the water in the lobby.","5"
"Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!","5"
"Good: Amazing hotel.good location.very clean.friendly staff.","5"
"Bad: Rooms are a little compact, but that had little impact on our stay!. Good: Location was excellent and the price was very reasonable compared to other properties. Staff were all amazing.","5"
"Good: can't wait to stay here again!","5"
"Good: It was a great location and had amazing decor.","5"
"Bad: There was nothing I did not like. Good: Art Deco, location, price, and bed....","5"
"Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing","5"
"Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there.","5"
"Good: Didnt smell like smoke, and no gambling","5"
"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip.","5"
"Bad: The phone receiver didn't work. And the room wouldn't get as cold as I like. Good: I love my stay at the Westin.","5"
"Good: I loved everything","5"
"Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas.","5"
"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all","5"
"Bad: .. Good: Five minute walk to The Strip - Belligio. Monorail station across the street at Bally's. Car hire agency in hotel.","5"
"Good: Right off strip with all extras included in room price","5"
"Good: It was located just off the strip and easy access to everything can't go wrong!!!","5"
"Good: The staff was incredibly accommodating! The pool was open 24 hours which was perfect for a late night dip after walking the strip! The view was gorgeous, and conveniently located near the strip.","5"
"Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue. Good: Cleanliness of the hotel, the polite and helpful staff.","5"

"Bad: No bank ATM's...scandalous...not fair. Good: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE WESTIN. This one didn't disappoint either. Location was great, staff was great and facilities were excellent and clean! The view want bad either.","5"
"Good: Top of the line..great","5"
"Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets.","5"
"Bad: Gym was closed. Only notification on website was the spa closure. Good: Great + accommodating staff","5"
"Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds","5"

"Bad: Overbooked, could not get additional night. Good: Nice accomodations.","5"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Extremely friendly staff. They help you in every difficulty. You can depend on them.","5"
"Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!","5"
"Good: This hotel it's the most amazing I have ever stay everything of this hotel it's just awesome","5"
"Bad: no breakfast incl. Good: close to action but off the strip, so quiet","5"
"Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!","5"

"Good: Great location, quiet rooms, wonderful staff. Was a real pleasure to stay there.","5"
"Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast.","5"
"Bad: Nice hotel in LV close to everything. Good: Everyyhing","5"
"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis.

"Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.","5"

"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !","5"
"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P.

"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic. Thank you to the FPA for everythingDear PIERRE-YVES L, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures!

"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager","5"
"I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager","5"

"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends","5"
"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager","1"
"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray","5"
"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager","5"

"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience.

"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager","1"

"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager","5"
"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel.

"This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge.

"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves.

"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We look forward to sharing your review with the team, and we hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Warmest Regards,The St. Regis Management Team","5"

"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel. Congrats and Thank you! Dear jfcollobert,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay and that our team provided you with excellent service.

"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

"Just an amazing place. You are treated like a king all the time. This place has ruined me for all other hotels. I am going again this weekend and cannot wait.

"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning!

"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"I have never been so impressed with the customer service of a hotel. Every single staff member went above-and-beyond to make us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel. I have traveled all over the world, and have never been more impressed with the level of hospitality provided at the St. Regis in NYC.Dear Julie D, A complimentary review such as yours is always welcomed.

"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager","5"
"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

"If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager","5"
"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms","5"

"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.","5"
"Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun..

"Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room.

"Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge.

"Good: The convienance to everything. Just by walking out the front door of Kinzie Hotel.","5"
"Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!","5"
"Good: No fuss, no hassle, delivers exactly what it says.","5"
"Bad: I wanted to watch Netflix and couldn't, BUT THEY SAID NETFLIX WAS COMING!! By the end of August the hotel is getting new TV system to watch my shows! So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well.","5"
"Bad: Absolutely nothing!. Good: Such a relaxing hotel in the hub of the city. Breakfast located on each floor next to the lift was great, bed was sooo comfy, bathroom fab and the view stunning. Cocktail hour with nibbles each night was such a nice touch. What makes the Kinzie thou are the staff!","5"

"Good: Great location. Staff was amazing","5"
"Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great.","5"

"Good: The staff were professional, friendly and eager to please. It was our anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us on arrival which was a really lovely touch. The Cavalier bar/restaurant is super and make sure you have Liam mix up one of his fabulous cocktails! Very central location but nice and quite hotel.","5"

"Good: Love the contemporary look with all of the art! Great location and friendly, helpful staff. It is walking distance to the San Francisco Museum of Art and to great shopping!","5"
"Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!","5"
"Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not.","5"
"Good: The staff is above and beyond friendly, and it's not insincere. Just great personality. Upgraded our room for my gf's birthday, and a complimentary bottle of wine. Nice touch!","5"
"We had an absolutely delightful stay at the charming 1906 Lodge. It's hard to know where to begin describing all the positive aspects of staying there! Our room, The Plunge, was spacious and clean.

"Great spot with kids and family. Would definitely stay here again. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Convenient to reading market. Nice to have breakfast included and hot coffee available all day. Kids loved the pool - although it was small.","5"
"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Very clean and comfortable rooms. Kitchenette included in the room. All staff was friendly and helpful. Great lobby and an excellent breakfast. Wonderful location, right across from the Philadelphia convention center and Reading Market. The Southeast Pennsylvania Regional Transit Association rail terminal and train to the airport is next to the Reading Terminal. Easy walk to Independence Mall. Lots of shopping and eating nearby.","5"
"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites. We will definitely look forward to staying here again .Dear saturn445,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem. Plan to return with my family! Definite yes for anyone staying in Center City.","5"
"This was my first stay at a Home2, and I was very pleased. The staff was excellent, the hotel clean and well-appointed, and breakfast was good and plentiful. The fitness center has sufficient equipment, but at least one machine did not work right and was not taken out of service/repaired during my week-long stay.","5"
"Perfect location in the center of the city. Right across the strret from the market. And 5 min walk to take the Phlash bus loop around the city -RIDE ALL DAY 5 BUCKS PER PERSON.

"The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again.","5"
"Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left.","5"
"Rooms are a bit small but you are in Chicago and don't spend much time in the room. Everything was very clean. Location was excellent. Close to restaurants and attractions. Pillows were wonderful. Fresh water and bottles available on each floor. Coffee and snacks in lounge morning and evening","5"
"Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!","5"
"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage.","5"
"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this.","5"
"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls. Come see us again soon.RegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager","5"
"I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast.","5"
"Good location, it's close to museums that I love. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing, moderate size. There's cold water to refill your water bottle. The price is affordable. I felt as if it was a safe area and I had no worries or concerns about the location. I enjoyed the next door restaurant. It's an easy breakfast location.Since I was staying by myself, I would have enjoyed a movie channel to buy from but I never found it.Good coffee for the morning.Dear MarjieThank you for your review and I am so glad that we succeeded in looking after you on many area's. I have passed on your comments to our housekeeping department as we all know that providing a clean room is essential and it is something we all take great pride in.When you are next in Chicago, we would be delighted to look after you again.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager","5"
"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.","5"
"I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space. We work hard to ensure all our guests' stay is as pleasurable as yours was.We look forward to being of service to you once again when you return to Las Vegas!Safe Travels,","5"

"Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review. We are really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope you come visit us again.","5"

"The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review.

"We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley.

"I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!","5"
"Inn at the Vines is always a great stay in Napa Vallley. Good rooms and nice, friendly employees make this a wonderful stay. Great price/value! We dont use the free breakfast at Dennys but still nice that is included. Good location for visiting wine country.","5"
"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.","5"
"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!","5"
"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again.","5"
"My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel! Genafer and the other woman in the office were both very friendly and I plan on staying there again when I go back in October!Rhonda S - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and we look forward to you and your husbands visit in October.

I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through.

"Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile!

"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon.

"My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible.","5"
"The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. We went to Napa to view the wineries and take a bike ride through the vinyards and then to San Francisco and off to Sonoma. Great location.We are so thrilled you had a great time in Napa. Please come see us again.","5"
"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event.","5"

"As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!","5"

"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.","5"
"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again.","5"
"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu.

"We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both. We hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"Tried out Aloft for the ADA rooms. Pleasantly surprised spacious rooms updated features. We will look for the brand in our travels. The receptionist was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. I was waiting for the concierge to give a breakfast recommendation and she was busy so the receptionist gave us a few with different styles and directions turned out great. Thank you Aloft for a great stayDelighted to hear of your stay with us and appreciate your feedback on our ADA rooms. We hope you will stay with us again in the future,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager","5"
"No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager","5"
"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"I have to say I had a great stay,...The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful....What more can you askThe bar down stairs was nice to have so you did not need to go out if you really didn't want to. They are located within dozen of place for Uber Eats if your staying in. Awesome! Thank's so much for choosing Aloft NOLA for your needs, we hope you'll be back again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"The rooms were very nice and spacious! The workers were friendly and very calm even though it was a big event going on in the city. The rooms were very clean and comfy beds. I enjoyed my stay overall.Clean and comfy is music to our ears. Thanks for the great review and we hope you get back to Aloft New Orleans Downtown!","5"
"This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway. Thanks for the kudos, see you next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!","5"
"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately. Rest assured we will address each item with our team for immediate correction.

"Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking. Not a happy camper...Sorry to hear of your disappointment with your room. We do realize those windowless rooms aren't for everyone. They are labeled when booking as Loft King Room but i'm not sure how your booking channel has that set up. If you would like, I'd be happy to take a look into that for you.

"Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!!

See you next time, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager","5"
"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager","5"
"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations","5"
"New hotel, the rooms the lobby you notice that this is a new building. It was very clean, we enjoyed our room and the lobby.Staff was all friendly and the breakfast was good (usual Hampton Inn breakfast).Dear bens9,Thank you for your raving review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa.

"This was a very nice Hampton Inn. Lobby area is very nice. Negatives- Breakfast is very busy. Not enough seating. Food is just OK. Our room did not get cleaned until after 5PM. We just got back from all day wine tasting. Maids did not knock they just walked in.","5"
"The staff is all very friendly, and facility was great! Over all a great experience. Everything for a family Vacation. Also there is a cute little farmers market and movie theater, and restaurants nearby.","5"
"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!","5"

"I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you again, Serina Najar.","1"
"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.","5"
"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.","5"
"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car.","5"
"If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated. Many perks like cookies. tea, coffee in the lobby during the day, complimentary hot breakfast, and a snack bar to take with us to San Francisco. Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Definitely staying with us we offer many other perks like 24 hour complementary tea and coffee, in addition to cookies and our on the run breakfast to go bags that are available Mon-Fri 6am to 10am, just swing by the front desk and the bags are available for all our guest.

"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites Napa. The staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent. There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa.

"This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new. It provides easy access to downtown Napa as well as to the main highway north to all the wineries. My room was on the ground floor, No. 130 and there was some noise from upstairs translated below but not bad. Also had really nice, big screen, TVs.Dear TSCClovisCa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa.

"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.","5"

"Really nice hotel. Room was fresh and clean. Fluffy pillows and comfy bed. Housekeeping was good.

"I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat.","5"

"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.","5"
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends.","5"
"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments. Steve is an amazing team member. He welcomes all of our guests with great libations and wonderful ideas on what to see and explore on the Island. Thanks for staying with us.","5"
"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager","5"
"Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!","5"
"I stayed here with a couple friends. Very friendly hotel! The weather was terrible, cold rainy, in the Keys. The staff was super helpful in helping us find things to do.

"The location wasn't exactly where i thought it was but that was partly my fault, there are 2 Fairfield's in Key west and I got confused with the second one. However it was nice and close to airport which is what I was looking for at first. The Hotel had a nice room, Clean, and everything you needed to just have a nice stay. They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice. It was just a nice hotel all around and we couldn't beat the price. Very happy with our stay here.Dear Ashley663,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel.

"Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating.

"Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean.

"For the cost of this hotel, I was extremely surprised on how nice, clean and modern looking it was. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with anything we needed, but most importantly I felt comfortable there because it was safe and secure and the inside and outside was well kept.

"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.","1"

"It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4.

"What a wonderful surprise this hotel was to us!! We were greeted by the front desk and treated like royalty. Although we had to wait a half hour til our room was ready, they made sure we were comfortable and gave us bottled water. The room was GREAT. A huge bathtub was a delight.

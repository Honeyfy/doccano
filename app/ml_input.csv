Hope you had a nice weekend. Curious to know how you have using Gong over the past week.

"303","Hey Matt,

Hope you had a nice weekend.

After reading one of your LinkedIn's posts, ""The hard close is dead. Here's what has replaced it"", I wanted to share a Gong Labs report that validates your point with hard data.

We analyzed over 40,000 closing sales calls and came to the surprising conclusion that successful and unsuccessful closing conversations look the same. By contrast, calls that happen upstream in the sales cycle (especially discovery calls) look starkly different in terms of which lead to closed or lost deals.

Here is the full report. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

Cheers,","6"

If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier’s check-in deadlines, which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons, denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline’s boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations.

"328","Stuart,

Noticed a few of your posts on Linkedin, one of them mentioning you had a growing team @ BlueVine, adding another AE. (and of course Ricky Bobby)

I'd assume that ramping your newer AE to hit quota ASAP is ""top of mind"" for you at the moment..

Thought you'd enjoy this video that shows how Bevin Lyon, a VP @ Intelex, was able to scale his growing team of AE's and decrease his on-boarding time using Gong.

Hope you enjoy the video, and if this make sense, would appreciate 30 minutes of your time to show you why we're now the #1 tool for sales in the Bay Area.

Best regards,","5"
"329","Hi Chris,

Wanted to circle back with you about the demo you requested a few days ago with Gong- Excited to get connected!

Do you have any white space this week to connect for a few minutes?

All the best,","5"
"330","Adi,

Reason for my follow-up - I remember chatting with Charna and yourself about your growing team, and potentially get Textio on a demo. Wanted to check in and see if Gong was something you guys still wanted to get a deeper look at?

Here's a brief little overview.

P.S: Meeting you and Charna were definite highlights of SaaStr. Glad your enjoying the move from NY -> Seattle. Just might have to move there myself, there's just no surf!!!

Cheers,","6"
"331","Hi Shane,

Based on that context, it sounds like you're hiring to accompany a more robust pipeline and convert on more to increase revenue.

Generally, this is actually a good time to begin build the ""analytics"" behind your calls today, so newer reps down the road will have a robust history to go off of for accelerated on-boarding.

Yes, on-boarding is one use case - but as a Sales Leader, what if you had the ability to 1. on-board them in half the time 2. decrease your sales cycle by 10-15% with your current team?

A deeper understanding of your team's conversations can course-correct lost opportunities and ultimately put you in a position to ensure each process is as transparent as possible with your prospects and customers.

How about this, you give us 30 mins. to show you how company's that are growing their sales team at a 40-60% clip are converting on more pipeline. If it doesn't hit the mark, we can reconnect at the end of the year.

Is that fair?","5"
"332","Hey Tanner,

Happy to elaborate.

We're currently in a pretty good spot with employee onboarding. Right now, we onboard about 1 new sales rep per month, which has made providing quality onboarding (info sessions, role playing calls, etc.) pretty easy. We've had good success with our last few hires on this basis.

I see Gong coming into the picture when we're at a point of onboarding a bunch of reps each month, so keeping on top of role play calls, etc. is challenging. In addition, we'll be looking to hire a sales coach/manager later on this year (when we're beyond the point of me being the coach) and I potentially see Gong being a useful tool for them.

Hope this helps,","6"
"333","Hi Branden,

Did you have a few minutes to chat this afternoon as we start Q2?

Best,","5"
"334","Hi Rich,

After coming off a successful Qxxtime OpenGov - we wanted to reconnect.

I forgot to mention that I saw you've shared a few of our articles around ""talk:listen ratios"" and top rep analysis. These data points can be easily unearthed on your sales team and on average sales cycles are decreasing by 7-10 days.

Did you have anytime to take a closer look at your sales process at OpenGov to align with Q2 goals?

Best,

Tanner","5"
"335","Hey Shane,

Appreciate the kind words and we always enjoy talking to fans of Gong.

Would you mind elaborating on what you mean by ""not in a spot to buy right now"" for future conversations?

With your success in mind,","6"
"336","Tanner,

I wanted to reiterate the power of our Google Chrome extension, which gives you our data in the places you spend the most time researching.

With it, while you're on anyone's LinkedIn page that we've profiled you can instantly get their direct phone, email, the technologies the company uses, any triggers, and then instantly upload that to your CRM or download to a spreadsheet.

Additionally, while you're on any company's website you can do the same and grab relevant contacts or the company data on techs, triggers, etc.

I'd be happy to run through this with you in <10 minutes, just reply to schedule a time or give me a call.","6"
"337","Hey Tanner,

Great emails dude. Fired this over to our team in Slack to show them what you can do with a bit of info on Linkedin.

You guys have great content and I like your product. We're not in a spot to buy this right now. I don't want to give you the old ""I'll reach out when it's relevant"" because I fucking hate getting that myself.

Maybe drop me a line every couple of months to see if it makes sense to connect then? I always have stuff like this on my mind, so I may follow up with you sooner.

I read your share on Linkedin --> ""What a VP Sales Does Behind Closed Doors"", and agreed that sales is only ""one spoke on a larger wheel."" It takes the whole company to drive a sale forward, a lot of collaboration is needed.

I thought you might share the same ""collaboration"" mindset with your sales team when it comes to the content of their calls and sales conversations.

"365","Daisy,

Noticed you liked Mark Smith's post mentioning that top reps listen more than they talk, and felt compelled to reach out and loop back around.

Thought you might have this ideal when it comes to your own sales team. We have analyzed 1 million calls to give insights into the ""talk-to-listen"" ratio that Mark mentions in his post.","6"
"366","Matt,

it was great catching up. hope you got my video. lets go surf that spot soon.

I'll send over the calendar invite, and Devin is should be ready to deep-dive everything that you and I chatted about.

1) Here's a link that you should check out of a previous demo/webinar, and a look at the platform. (a bit lengthy)

2) And another statistical analysis of what Gong has been doing so far.

RE: Gong I’m pretty interested in setting a foundation to start analyzing and gathering insights from the Zoom recordings we have stored. We’re an early stage company, I’m about to hire a few more MDRs, and we’ll be having many more sales conversations (prospecting & actual meetings) in the next couple months thanks to some agent-assisted dialing technology I pulled the trigger on a month ago. Not sure what pricing is, but want to throw out there that we have a conservative CEO and measurable value needs to be established if we can invest in this. I’ll be your coach- let me know how I can help, and if you want to get on the phone, I’m open now through the rest of the day (no client meetings today).","6"

We sent you over a G2 Crowd report on why Gong is a great compliment to pushing competition like xxlink out of the way.

I’d appreciate a shot @ 30min to show you how we’ve been cloning top rep behavior amongst “middle-of-the-pack” reps to boost quota attainment, and if you’re not impressed, we can shake hands and walk away.

"392","Is there a way to set a product demo to expire at a certain time. IE 1 week for demo and 90 days for a training session?","5"
"393","Hi Jay,

Yes you are correct. A couple ""just in case"" steps here:

- The Google Apps needs to be connected via the steps you stated

- Your individual reps will need to make sure the xxlink URLs are in the calendar invites

- Your individual reps need to make sure that they start the actual meeting via the computer (not just use the conference line)

This will enable Gong to join those meetings.

Best,","6"
"394","Hey Jameson,

Sorry I didn't get back to you on the VM from a few days back.

When you speak about connecting calendars, assume thats done via settings/integrations/google apps, while also having the xxlink integration enabled?

Once we have both setup on a users account, is there anything else we need to enable the autmaion.

J","6"
"395","Hey Dave,

Sorry for the delay, crazy EOQ over here! I don't have the ability to see logs of who turned on/off certain functionalities, but I can tell you these are the only people who have admin access at DO, so would be limited to one of these folks (BTW if any of these people should NOT have admin permissions, we can adjust):

Looking at your AE scorecard, I see that it is applied only for Steve Bryerton vs. Anyone on Steve Bryerton's team. This would mean that only calls where Steve is the host, you can score. I imagine you were looking for them to be applied at the team level, correct? Let me know if this would explain it, or if not, happy to dive in further!​

"396","Thanks for sending this Jackie, this is great! BTW, better back-to-back meeting support has not been released yet, rather the team has committed to rolling it out by EOM June, so reps should see a lot of improvements here (which should also fix the prompt playing in the middle of meetings) after they are back from your 4th of July break.","5"

Hi Samantha,

Thanks for reaching out, I’m happy to help.

At a first pass, I’m not seeing this as part of the original House Security review for Gong, which means we will require a separate House Security review to move this forward. Is there an approved add-in that sits within the MSFT Store?

"407","Hi all,

It’s been three months since we’ve been using Gong and we hope you’re all getting a lot out of it!

I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on the pilot, as well as some responses to feedback we’ve received over the past several weeks.

Pilot Update

- We will continue using Gong throughout July. LinkedIn’s upcoming renewal with Gong is in August and we will be assessing future use over the next month. More to come in late July but business as usual for now!

- Managers are working with Sam, the Gong CSM, to see how we can use Gong for deeper insights. We have a working session on 7/12 where we will learn more.

Feedback & Responses

1. The intro prompt is distracting and there is inconsistency as to when it comes on.

LinkedIn requires that we have the prompt and we have chosen this one specifically. This issue with inconsistency as to when it comes on is due to LinkedIn’s workflows with Bluejeans/Webex. In June, Gong built adjustments specifically for LinkedIn in order to improve this issue. While you should be seeing a slight improvement, this is a common theme Gong is hearing from LinkedIn and there is continual work being done on how to make a greater change here. To help mitigate this issue, CSMs should log into their call one minute before the start time so the prompt starts promptly (pun intended).

2. Recording back-to-back calls presents a challenge.

This is the root cause of the workflow issues mentioned above and there should have been a slight improvement with the adjustments Gong released in June.

3. Gong doesn’t work with Bookings.

We are working with the Bookings admin to understand what’s feasible here and will follow-up with any updates in due time. For now, you can either forward the calendar invite to your client or Gong has functionality where you can manually add Gong to the call.

4. When manager submits feedback via Gong, a separate email is sent each time. Would be better if it could be one summary email.

When a manager sits down to provide feedback on a call, there is a delay in the email so that all feedback on a single call is grouped together and sent at one time. The above will happen when a manager reviews the call in Gong over a longer period of time (say, throughout the day or over the course of 24 hours).

As always, please send your feedback to your manager or directly to me. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out!

Thanks,","6"

"413","Hi Aisha,

While I can definitely send you a copy of the call, I unfortunately don't have the bandwidth to host multiple training calls - looping in Neil so that we can reschedule and find a time that works for everyone. Since you have specific questions, I'd like to make sure we have a chance to discuss!","5"
"414","Hey Sam,

I don't think my email ever went out to you but definitely would love to connect with you. When works best?

We would love to get a training session from you as well if we can we have had some new hires as you have see and some turnover that it may make sense to get an hour with you.","5"
"415","Hi Eran,

Thanks for the feedback, but I’m not sure I’m clear on a few things.

“Custom fields is something we'll be launching soon, but they apply to accounts, opportunities and contacts, which you're not using in this usecase.” – we are using accounts and contacts. Are you saying you won’t have access to task (activity) custom fields?

“If you can have Connect and Sell to associate calls done by a specific rep to a specific contact or account in salesforce, then the call name in Gong will contain the rep's name and you can create saved queries in Gong that will only show their calls, where you can report on them, etc.” – not sure what you’re specifying here, as this is already the case (call dispositions create a task related to the contact & account being called) – all we are missing is the rep name (or client name).

If you can clarify on those points, that will help me with next steps.

Thanks,","6"
"416","Hey Sam,

Kevin is no longer at LI and Anu is brand new. We'll definitely want to record her calls as well as Mario's, and Janesh's calls as well. Thanks for checking in.

"417","Hi Samantha,

I’m on LaRon Johnson’s team in the LinkedIn Detroit office. Yesterday he forwarded us a couple tip sheets and I was wondering if we can set up a 30-min WebEx demo with you to highlight the most effective ways to use Gong and get any questions the team may have answered?

If this is possible, the week of July 9th will work the best for us (Tues or Thurs). Please let me know once you get a chance.

Thanks,","6"
"418","Got it - couldn't recall if we had a renewal coming up - can we talk the week after next? There are some names that need to be turned off but I am hiring as well so may actually end up growing","5"
"419","Maybe it's that we supplemented the inside-Gong scorecard process with something our Sales Ops team engineered. But I thought we'd still have the ability to use the original scorecard.

Don't need a reply here. I'll take it up internally.

~Dave","6"
"420","...I think I answered my own question. The AE Scorecard was disabled. But not by me. Is there a way to find out when and by whom this was disabled? Sorry to roll up on you at end of quarter in fire-drill mode, but this is super important to our enablement momentum, and I'm confused as to how this happened.

Thanks for any insight when you can, Samantha.

"421","Thanks Samantha

I see the details in the PDF file which I have taken to the team.

"422","Hi, Samantha.

If we have had scorecards setup, what would be the reason the ""Score Call"" option isn't there for some calls??

~Dave","6"
"423","Hi Jim - no timing ""issues"" we just look at your usage every quarter compared to the number of recorded users you are contracted for and ask that you ""true-up"" your agreement if you'd like them to remain recorded.

Currently ToolWatch is contracted for 8 recorded users, and you've got 12 recorded users - if you'd like all 12 to remain on we will simply send you an order that is prorated through the end of your original contract.

Thanks,","6"
"424","Hey Sam - I haven't forgotten about this. We are in the process of coming up with all the revised talk tracks and measurements of our new sales methodology we're rolling out. This should take about a week and then I'll upload everything into Gong and book some time for all of us to review this as well as the other use cases and best practices you previously mentioned wanting to run through.","6"

"436","Hey Sam,

Hope all is going well, quick question about who get's notified when one sends comments within a call.

I'd like these comments to be open to everyone but i only want the call owner to get pinged once i send that comment.. It seems that any person the call was shared with will get pinged once they are on that list.

Can this be changed?

xxlink","6"
"437","Jonathan and Walter,

I'll be traveling tomorrow and should have internet access on the plane, but in the event it sketchy on the plane Jameson will take the lead on getting you updated paperwork based off your final user count.

Thanks,","6"
"438","Hey Sam,

Yes, I'd recommend both having a segment for just the CS team and AE team as well as one joint team. The way we have it working here is a success team, a sales team (I'm not a part of this) and an everyone team. For items I want to share with the sales team, I share with the everyone team.

There isn't much of a disadvantage - in fact I find it pretty helpful if I'd like to get some insights into who else been communicating with customers I'm now managing. It's been a great way for us to keep everyone on the same page.

As time goes on, there might be some issues around template management - but hopefully we'll have a great solution for you by the time you get there since we're currently thinking about the template organization issue larger teams are facing.

Hope this helps!","6"
"439","Thanks Lo,

So occasionally the CS team (xxtime growing) will want to share templates with the Sales team, so would you recommend we all be one big team instead of being segmented? Adding 1 by 1 will not be a good option as the teams are constantly growing, so managing will not be easy. Any disadvantages to having everyone on the same team?","6"
"440","Hey Taylor,

It looks like you and Sam are not part of any teams together. In order for Sam to share the templates, you'll need to be on the same team (or she can add each individual, but that's very tedious).

Luckily anybody can create a team. And if you're an admin on a team, you can add other folks. Taylor, I'd recommend adding Sam to your team so she sees the option to share with you all. Then it's just a one button click in the share section.

Let me know if that does the trick for you.

Best,","5"
"441","Sounds good. By the way, Adam is working to get a call scheduled with all the managers to go over best practices - if that is what you're wanting to discuss then I'd recommend working with him to schedule that call sooner. If it is for other topics, let me know when you have availability.

Thanks!","6"
"442","Hi Sandhya,

The intention is that we do mirror your salesforce hierarchy exactly, have you double checked that those users no longer roll up to Stacy in SFDC? Regardless, they won't have any access to Gong because they are not provisioned in Okta. For the past 6 months of provisioning LinkedIn users, the hierarchy has always been correct, aside from the occasional mistake in LI's SFDC, or just a brief delay in Workday updates. Also, as I mentioned on the call on Monday, we will soon be deprovisioning all Gong users in SFDC once they are inactive in SFDC.

Let me know if I can further clarify!","6"
"443","Thank you Rick!

Here are a couple articles (copying and pasting the content since I don't believe you have a Gong credential yet) which should answer some of those questions. Adding our COO, Eran, to help fill in any other gaps.","6"
"444","Hi Deon,

Thanks for reaching out, I'd be happy to! One thing I noticed though is that only yourself and Sean are currently recording calls on that team, with Zee turned on but not connected to his calendar. To maximize our efforts here, will this call be with the whole team?","6"
"445","Hey Lo - Sam (cc'd) who is on our CS team just created templates for us (sales) to use for handoffs and can't share it with us - I think our accounts may not be linked?

Can you check?","6"
"446","Hi Samantha,

Sorry for the delay response as I was having VIP issue.

I was successfully able to login to Gong and also checked my settings to provision users going forward. But I have a doubt as I just checked for Stacy and her team I did not see all her direct reports reporting to her instead saw the people who left the company. So can you please clarify is Gong not up to date with SFDC.

Thanks,","6"
"447","Sounds good Adam, thanks for the update!","6"
"448","ETA is July. Please let the team know!

Thanks,","6"
"449","Hey Brandon,

That may be a tougher task to do, as we would need to find a group in GroupID that has all sales employees besides the ones in EMEA. Do you have a contact on your end that knows of a group that exists containing All Sales minus EMEA? I can discuss with our identity team, but I don't know of one off the top of my head.

Regards,

Chris

"450","Hey Chris,

Is it possible to exclude the EMEA-based reps from the OKTA list?

Context is that we’re getting some push back from Legal & Privacy because they are just starting to evaluate the potential to use Gong in EMEA for call recording. I clarified that the OKTA distribution only gives users there listen-only access, but they’d like to pull back the OKTA tile from EMEA-based employees for the time being.

Best,

"453","Hi Samantha!

Thanks for all your help. I'd like to get on a quick call with you next week to see about setting up other topics.

I'll send you some availability if you let me know which days work best.

Thanks!","6"
"454","Thanks, Sam. BTW -my old manager is going to Gong as CRO. He’s a great person so you all scored!","6"
"455","Hi Shany,

Apologies for the delayed response, your invoice is scheduled for payment early next week.

Thank you

"456","Hey Dave,

All set. The larger issue was that Jake rolled up to Steve, there was a scorecard applied to Jake's team and since you cannot apply more than 1 scorecard to a team, when you try to apply a scorecard to Steve's team - that also included Jake's team, which would be 2 scorecards.

It's a valid use case, so I've sent it to my team, but for the time being I just had Jake roll up to you vs. Steve (we can easily change it back) until the product team builds better support for this. Let me know if there's anything I can clarify!","5"
"457","Thanks, Sam.

Indeed, I intend(ed) for anyone on Steve Bryerton's team to be score-able, and thought that was what I did when I re-enabled the AE Demo Scorecard. Can you either quickly let me know how to include everyone on Steve's team, or do it for me? Looking now and don't see how I would do that differently than I already tried.

Thanks.

I tried your office line - but your colleague said you were busy.

A key thing about being a triathlete, or an athlete even, and the connection with a sales team, is the necessity of consistent practice, and coaching reps through the process.

We've worked with large-scaling companies like Linkedin and Salesloft to reveal the anatomy of a successful sales call through our coaching platform.

Really love seeing a fellow Gaucho and former Ranger make their way to a position of your caliber. I hope to follow in your footsteps one day. Olé! I was chatting with Sophia Yamauchi the other day and she mentioned your partnership with Chorus.

Reaching out now because we've recently seen a number of Chorus' clients (Datanyze & Teamable to name a few) running into significant bottlenecks with their platform as of late (around reporting and functionality), particularly as they scale.

Just like Sysdig helps developers, administrators and other IT professionals get deeper visibility into their systems and containers, Gong helps VPs of Sales' like yourself get deeper visibility into your sales conversations.

Were you able to chat with Chris at all about referral/partner programs? I haven't been able to find anything on your site and think it could be a game-changing project to kickoff in Q2.

If you could loop in Chris that would be incredible.

Cheers,","6"
"517","Chris,

I saw there are currently 9 openings within your sales organization As CRO, you understand it's impossible to sit in on the 52 reps sales calls or meetings right now and only gets more difficult as your scale.

With the average 45-minute sales call having over 6000 words said and only a fraction of that ending up in the opportunity notes, you're at the mercy of the ""objectivity"" of your reps and sales leaders.

Mike Lambert, the CRO at Outsytems encountered a similar problem and used Gong to ""shine a light on why one rep is performing well and why another is struggling,"" and increase the close rates of his team by 5%.

If this is relevant, can we continue this conversation Thursday at xxtime

Best Regards,","5"
"518","Chris,

With your experience growing sales teams to over 100 reps spread across the country, you understand the difficulty of onboarding and ramping each new sales rep.

Since on your Linkedin, you point out that you specialize in ""hiring, training, motivating, monitoring, and leading by example,"" I thought It might be relevant for me to reach out.

We partner with SVP of Sales like yourself to help make scaling the things you specialize in easy and manageable.

I'd appreciate a shot for 30 min next Tuesday at xxtime , to show how Gong helps sales teams boost quota attainment and eases onboarding. If you're not impressed, I won't chase you...Fair?

"523","Hey Mac,

With 14% growth in the sales team last year and 9 openings in the sales department currently (per your website), I imagine finding a way to continue to forecast accurately and get a holistic view of your reps activity as your scale is top of mind.

By having visibility into your sales conversations, you can quickly surface key performance differences between reps and gain objective insight that will produce much a more accurate forecast of your team's pipeline.

Do you have time on Thursday at xxtime to continue the conversation?

Best Regards,","5"
"524","Jason,

VerticalScope's Linkedin shows that your sales team has grown 15% over the last year. I Imagine ramping those new hires quickly to start contributing to your revenue quota is top of mind.

That's where I think we can offer some support by making it easy to identify what your top reps do differently and help your ""middle of the pack"" reps replicate that behavior.

Can we continue this conversation Wednesday at xxtime ?

Best Regards,","5"
"525","Hey Jim,

Steve Kraner said you're ""possibly the best sales coach on the planet,"" in his recommendation of you on your Linkedin.

I imagine trying to coach all 50 reps at Black Duck can be difficult and time-consuming. What if you could spend less time coaching more reps by quickly searching through calls for coachable moments and respond when a rep asks for advice without having to listen to the whole 45-minute demo?

Can we continue this conversation on Thursday at xxtime ?

Best Regards,","5"
"526","Joel,

On your Linkedin, you talk about new tech will provide opportunities of a scale never seen before, and how well-trained sales teams will exploit this by focusing on using the new tech to provide value with hiring, training, motivating and managing them.

Not to get super ""pitchy"" on you, but that's pretty much what we help with. At Kareo, a company with a similar sized sales team as Spireon, they used Gong to decrease onboarding ramp time by 20%, increase close rates by 30% and ultimately decrease the sales cycle length by 50%.

Can we continue this conversation next Thursday at xxtime ?

Best Regard,","5"
"527","Hi Eric,

I saw that you are hiring another SDR for your team. Imagine how fast they could ramp if they were able to listen to your team's calls and the AE's demos to learn your specific talking points and buyer personas?

Do you have some time Thursday at xxtime  to continue the conversation?

I can give you 30 minutes to hear you out. Pick a time after xxtime eastern and we can make it happen.

Do yourself a big favor and make certain your points include the fact all of my outside reps are 55+ and refuse to embrace SF mobile. I am also facing challenges getting them acclimated with MS Outlook after years of using Zimbra.

Send me the invite and we can talk.","5"
"539","Hey Mike,

So our pricing depends on the organization size etc, but the basics are a 5K platform fee and xxmoney/year per recorded user with unlimited listening licenses. Here is our one-pager as well.

I know you said that you wanted to possibly do a full eval depending on offsetting costs, but I think to make the best use of your time that it makes sense for you to talk with an AE about costs and ROI.

Let me know your thoughts on that.

Best,

Danny","6"
"540","Broderick,

That's a bummer. Hopefully, you won't end up missing too much, haha. I know a lot of these conferences can start to feel like groundhog day 😉

Increasing accountability and establishing process can be tedious at first, but it eventually makes everything easier, especially for new hires (I saw you're hiring an SDR).

One of our clients, Greg Reffner, was in a similar position at his company Allbound a little while ago and turned to us for some support. We helped him decrease his onboarding time by 58 days, increase close rates and forecast accuracy and ultimately decrease their sales cycle by 76 days.

I know you said something like this is a ways off, but I think it could add value immediately to your day-to-day and help with this transition.

If you're open to setting aside 30 minutes tomorrow, I think we could do a better job of showing you the value and ROI of this for your team.

Best,

Danny","5"
"541","Hey, Greg

I'm around this week. My assistant can arrange a call. But confirming first:

We're a b2b digital agency doing sdr and sales for technical clients. We have 1 sdr and xxtime to grow to maybe 5x that. Call volume is low.

We use Kixie as our dialer (which I didn't see as an integration) and we use ProsperWorks for our CRM. We do use xxlink and I saw an integration there so maybe that can help?

But usually companies that ask you to fill out a form to get pricing are targeting enterprise and we certainly aren't that.

Thanks,","5"

This is a discovery call to learn more about your team and make sure we use your time efficiently on the demo.

If you'd like to jump straight to the demo, we can reschedule and get you set up with the right people on our team.

I just have a few questions to make sure we use your time efficiently on the demo:

1. What kind of web-conferencing solution or dialer do you currently use?

2. How many reps do you currently have running on that tool?

Let me know what works best for you.

Good morning,

A Dozen Demands

The Trump administration put Iran on notice that any new deal would require it to stop enriching uranium and halt its support for militant groups in the region, demands that Tehran swiftly rejected. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spelled out 12 requirements for a new agreement that would require a wholesale change in Iran’s military posture in the Middle East. In exchange, he said the U.S. would lift the punishing economic sanctions it is now moving to impose, restore diplomatic ties and allow Iran to have access to advanced technology. The proposal, combining nuclear and regional issues, was greeted skeptically by European leaders who are working to preserve the 20xxtime Iran denounced the new demands. “The world of today doesn’t accept that the U.S. decides for the world,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said. Oil prices headed toward xxmoney a barrel following the U.S. threat.

Risk-On Trade

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged nearly 3xxtime Monday to its highest level in more than two months as concerns about a possible trade war between the U.S. and China eased. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. will suspend its efforts to apply tariffs to xxmoney billion in Chinese imports. In another sign of a thaw, the U.S. and China late Monday agreed on a broad outline to save ZTE, a Chinese telecom giant that U.S. lawmakers see as a security threat. The deal would lift the sales ban on ZTE in exchange for major management changes. Still, analysts cautioned that the optimism could be short-lived. And with no specific timetable for the next steps in the trade negotiations, investors are likely to continue facing uncertainty over xxlink relations. The Journal’s Greg Ip writes that although China holds the weaker hand in the dispute, it has played it far better.

Public Roast

Starbucks tried to dig itself out of controversy by clarifying a policy toward nonpaying guests that generated an onslaught of weekend criticism. The Seattle-based retailer on Saturday said its U.S. company-owned stores would allow anyone to use the cafes, including the restrooms, without a purchase. The announcement drew complaints that cafes would turn into homeless shelters and drug havens. Starbucks revealed more about the policy Monday, telling the Journal that employees now have detailed instructions on what to do if someone is behaving in a disruptive manner. At issue is whether Starbucks views itself as a business that caters to customers, or a quasi-public place generally open to all. Having promoted itself as a “third place” between home and work where people can exchange ideas freely, the coffee chain essentially pioneered the idea that is now generating controversy.

Headache Relief

The first in a new class of migraine drugs approved last week by the Food and Drug Administration is giving hope to the estimated 37 million people in the U.S. who suffer from the often-debilitating headaches. Touted as the first treatment designed specifically to prevent migraines, the injectable drug by Amgen and Novartis called Aimovig is expected to be available to patients within a week for an annual price of xxmoney. Until now, migraine patients have largely had to take drugs created to treat other diseases, such as epilepsy and high blood pressure. That often means unwelcome side effects. That was the dilemma for Delaware psychologist Lisa DeLeonardo, who enrolled in the Amgen/Novartis trial in 2015. While some doctors warn the new treatment is over-hyped, Dr. DeLeonardo called it “life-changing.”

READER RESPONSE

Responding to yesterday’s question on President Trump’s call for a review of the probe into his campaign, Steve Chanecka of California wrote: “While it is certainly delicate politically, President Trump is justified in questioning the DOJ et al. on an ever-widening, far-reaching investigation that clearly has strayed far from its alleged focus—whether Russians colluded with the Trump campaign.” Rebecca Marsnik of Washington, D.C., said: “I never think it’s a bad thing to have more checks on the government. So an extra review of the probe into President Trump’s campaign seems reasonable to make sure that everything is kosher. However, President Trump himself calling for the review of what is checking him (especially via Twitter) raises red flags as to his real intentions.” Joshua Morris of Texas shared: “The more Mr. Trump wages a PR campaign against a legitimate investigation into how Russia interfered in our democracy, [the] more it seems like there’s something to hide. The loudest message would be to stay silent and let his accomplishments speak for themselves.”

"633","Hi Chris!

Finally getting around to launching the widget and it's not working for some reason

I publish it to Test and it works great.

Then I publish the same thing to Production and it doesn't show up.

Any ideas?","5"
"634","Ryan,

Thanks for your time today. It is my understanding that other Speech Analytics partners are using our API to extract calls from our recorders. I am attaching the document I mentioned which offers some good insight into the capabilities of our API. I am also copying my colleague Christopher Heyne who can answer further questions and/or bring in other resources who can be helpful.

I’d be interested in seeing a demo of your product if that can be arranged. Please let me know, ok? Thank you!

Regards,","6"
"635","Hi Matt!

I was forwarded your information in order to get you in touch with my Product Manager for API documentation so here he is!

Dear Ryan DeForest, You have a new text message:","6"
"638","Hi ​Ryan​,

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for being a part of Pulse. It wouldn’t have been the same without you!

I’m sure you know how valuable NPS can be as a benchmarking tool, and Pulse is no exception. I send out this survey each year after Pulse and it’s the single greatest lever in how we do things differently (or the same) next year.

Would you be able to take two minutes to complete this NPS? I’ll read every answer and we'll work hard to incorporate your feedback into Pulse 2019.

On a scale of 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend Pulse to a friend or colleague?What were the best parts of Pulse 2018?What should we do differently for Pulse 2019?

Thank you so much for helping me with this important first step toward Pulse 2019. Simply reply to this email with your answers or ​fill out this online questionnaire​ ​to log your response.

All the best,","5"
"639","Hi James!

Can you share some day and times that work for you and your PureCloud Consultant so we can all hop on a call next week?

Best,

"640","Hi guys - just following up here.

Happy Friday as well!","6"
"641","No change on our side. Is this for a specific user or the admin integration account?

Looks like the same error we saw before when a user just needed to enter in their 2FA code again.

Any more details Ryan?

"642","Hey Ryan,

Hope everything with Linkedin went well!

What does your schedule look like for next week?

Want to stick with Gong, but have to justify these kinds of decisions to investors while we’re still small...

Either of these scenarios would be a go for us today:

2) 10 seats at xxmoney, additional seats at xxmoney each

"654","Hey Tanner – hit me up early next week to get something scheduled.

Thanks,","5"
"655","Hi Brady,

My colleague, Bryan, spoke with Eitan a few weeks back around Gong and mentioned you'd be interested in continuing the conversation.

I also noticed you were endorsed by the Director of Sales from Iterable, a current client of Gong.

How does next Tuesday look on your end to chat further?

Best,","5"
"656","Hi Jim,

We spoke last month and asked me to reach out in May to chat further around Solink and Gong.

Did you have time next Tuesday at xxtime to reconnect?

Tanner","5"
"657","Hi Christi,

Truly appreciate you getting back to me - I wouldn't want to waste his time if he wouldn't have a hand in a decision around a tool like Gong.

Would you kindly ask him if he'd be open to introducing me to the correct person at Daxko?

Thank you,","5"
"658","Hi Tanner,

I am JB’s assistant, and he asked me to reach out to you. He would be glad to give you a few minutes, but wanted to let you know that since our company has recently reorganized, he is not in control of the sales systems, therefore it is unlikely worth your time. If you would still like to speak with him, let me know and I can look for some 15 minute time slots on his calendar that would be available. I can tell you that next Monday and Tuesday are off the table, as he is traveling.

Thank you,

Christi","5"
"659","Hi Ian,

I saw you liked Jocko Willink's post about the correlation between not hitting the snooze button and just getting up without thinking.

Interesting enough he's speaking at Outreach's Unleashed Conference next week.

Are you attending the conference? If so, it would be great to meet!

Best,

Tanner","5"
"660","Hi Amyra, hope you've been well

I noticed you transitioned from Kareo, a current client of Gong.

It's always a pleasure speaking to past users and in your position at CriteriaCorp, we thought it made sense to reconnect and hear more about your success.

What are your thoughts on connecting further around how Kareo cut down sales cycles and increased quota attainment with Gong's help?

Best,

Tanner","5"
"661","Hi Sue,

After your exposure to Gong at Cirrus Insight - I wanted to see if it made sense to reconnect in your new role.

When would be an appropriate time to follow up?","6"
"663","Yep, I understand where it fits. It’s just not the right time.","6"
"664","Hi Brandon,

It looks like you're off to the races at Quickpivot - we had set aside some time last month to connect.

What are your thoughts on catching up tomorrow?

Appreciate the transparency - i've heard great things about Vidyard.

So are you recording calls through Hubspots Calling App and are you running demos via web-conferencing currently?","6"
"668","Hi Tanner,

Traveling and in meetings all day.

My sales tools budget for this quarter is likely going to be used on Vidyard. That will delay gong for a few months.

That said, one of the things I’m curious about is hubspot CRM integration. Recording calls from hubspot in app calling feature would pop the priority for sure.

J","6"
"669","Hi Jim,

I tried to reach you a few minutes ago, but to no avail.

"672","Hi Amyra,

Apologies for catching you right before an important call - Great to chat with you again!

I was catching up with a few colleagues who worked with you during your time at Kareo and we wanted to reconnect in your new role at Criteria Corp.

How does tomorrow at xxtime sound to unpack how Greenhouse, Ziprecruiter, and other firms are leveraging Gong to drive revenue?

Best,","5"
"673","Hi Germain,

It's been a few months since we last spoke and noticed you raised a Series C (Must be an exciting time)

How does tomorrow at xxtime sound on your end to reconnect?

"674","Hi William,

If Gong is in the cards for 2018, did you have a few minutes to reconnect tomorrow?

Tanner","6"
"675","Hi Gary,

Hope you've been well - the last time you spoke with my colleague you were focused on maximizing cross sell opportunities.

Best,

Tanner","6"
"676","Hi Joanna,

We haven't had the pleasure of connecting yet, but wanted to make sure we set aside time in May as you roll out Zoom.

Did you have anytime this week to chat?

Best,","5"
"677","Hi Paul,

I noticed you're overseeing several sales team's across the U.S. and often times visibility into the conversations your sales reps are having can be difficult to surface.

As you continue to build the Digital Sales Function - what if you had the ability to understand what messaging lead to higher conversions?

Act-On turned to Gong to increase quota attainment by replicating top rep behavior across the team.

Did you have time tomorrow to continue the conversation?

Best,

Tanner","5"
"678","Hi Jamie,

Appreciate the conversation this morning and look forward to connecting.

For context - Sales Leaders at Act-On, DiscoverOrg, and Linked-In turned to Gong to shine a light on their sales conversations to replicate top rep behavior and drive revenue north.

How does tomorrow at xxtime or Wednesday AT xxtime look on your end?

Best,

Tanner","5"
"679","If that's the case - we do think a conversation could still take place.

We could show him what Gong could do for his line of business and if made sense down the road, loop in other lines.

Let me know the best way to proceed and truly appreciate all the help, Christi.","6"
"680","He is the right person for our specific line of business, just not for the entire organization. He said that at this time it likely wouldn’t be a good use of time.

Thank you,

Christi","6"
"681","Hi Brady,

I saw Rozier and Tatum had another great game for the Celtics, all while Eric Bledsoe caught the came from his couch (Go Celtics!)

On another note, did you have time tomorrow at 12 or xxtime to connect?

Best,

Tanner","5"
"682","Hi Paul,

I noticed Veem has grown tremendously on the sales side since you spoke with my colleague, Alex, last year.

As you continue to grow the team in Canada and the U.S. - visibility into the conversations your reps are having are crucial to understanding what messaging is landing with potential customers.

How does next Tuesday look on your end to unpack how your team can convert on more pipeline in 2018?

With your success in mind,

Tanner","6"
"683","Hi Brian,

We are all set for xxtime tomorrow.

"684","Hi Todd,

I hope you've been well - we wanted to follow up after the AAISP event and see if it made sense to chat further around Gong and Brandpoint.

Did you have anytime next week to continue the conversation?

Best,

Tanner","6"
"685","Hi Paul,

My colleague, Alex, spoke with you last year around Gong and we wanted to reconnect after your recent promotion to Sr. Director of Sales - Congrats!

How does next Tuesday look on your end to continue the conversation?

Best,

Tanner","5"
"686","Alex,

you had chatted with our CEO Amit Bendov @ Gong about a potential partnership in 2017, but decided to take a closer look at Chorus.

Considering your investment in the conversation intelligence space, I wanted to make sure you guys were looking at the right solution in 2018 to increase success and get the edge on Brightfunnel / Terminus.

If you're willing to lend some time, I'd love to show you what improvements we've made since then, and why we're leading the market. If you're not impressed, promise not to chase you :)

Look forward to chatting,","5"

Sincere apologies for missing our meeting.

We had an important customer visit to the office, and I could not get away.

I do apologies.

I understand that the Twiggle free evaluation has been running longer then a week.

I suggest we give it till end of next week, Yael our VP Marketing who is responsible for the SDR’s have been away all this week, so had no chance to speak with her and push this forward.

I believe I can get the team to see the value and purchase it by end of next week, I understand we can not keep using it without paying.

Can you reschedule to next week? I thought you were making a connection to salesloft and outreach for me, but I haven't heard anything. I just sent inquireies for pricing so I'm sure I'll hear back from them, but regardless, will need additional time to check out dialers.

"716","Hey Lindsay,

It's Luciano with Gong. I'm about to intro you to one of our prospect who is interested in replacing their current dialer. I recommended he buys Outreach so he can easily connect to Gong.

Their current solution doesn't correctly log activity into salesforce. Also, their customer service has been very disappointing.

Looking forward to working this account together.

"728","Hi Vik,

Hope you enjoyed the long weekend.

Are you still interested in seeing a demo of Gong?

If its ok with you, I was hoping to set up a call with your VP of Sales, Richard Jones, and one of our Account Executives, to show him how Gong's data-driven approach can help drive revenue.

How does next Tuesday @ xxtime  work for you?

Excited to get the conversation started.

Best,","5"
"729","Phil, Bill,

Excuse rich email but want to make sure we make the most of our call today.

Below is a summary of where we see Gong adding value at PathFactory. I've used our discovery call as a basis for the summary (and inserted snippets of our discussion where appropriate) but also made assumptions based on the challenges we normally see in similar use-cases.

The performance gap at PathFactory is currently skewed to the extremities. This is both bad and good news as it means that there are more underperformers and overperformers than average.

Implication of performance gap is the cost of lower conversion rates across a subsection of your sales team. This means that there are qualified opportunities that can advance to later stages but are failing to do so.

Why? Underperformers need to work through more qualified leads to close the same amount of deals as overperformers.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the ability to conduct effective discovery and thoroughly understand buyers’ needs sets your overperformers apart from the rest of the team. This is especially true since PathFactory brings to market an innovative product that needs to be carefully positioned based on different buyers personas.

The performance gap is caused by an equal gap in the quality of conversations your reps are having today. Close this gap first with coaching, and you will increase performance.

Today, you are already addressing this gap but only with partial visibility into your customer interactions. In fact, you are spending too much time manually acquiring few recordings that only provide anecdotal evidence to coach your team.

Gong can help you streamline the entire process while drastically improving it’s effectiveness. With our AI engine, you can automatically distill the components of every single sales call from your top performers to the bottom, so you can identify not only a few exemplary tactics that work, but also the pain points or drop-offs that don’t.

Every sales call from every member of the sales force is recorded. Gong listens, transcribes, and analyzes every call to distill key themes, questions, or proof points.

Aggregate results are used at scale to generate insights for the entire sales force.

Sales leaders (as well as everyone else in the company) can use these insights to identify key dialogue, topics, and even conversation cadence most effective at closing sales.

Looking forward to connecting later today.

All the best,","5"

Amir, I set some time on your calendar for us to connect tomorrow morning. Let's understand exactly how Gong can add value at CloudTask and discuss next steps.

Thanks,","5"

"734","I am very excited to hear! Luciano from our sales team can help you in the process

Best,","5"
"735","No worries, thanks Luciano.","6"
"736","Glenn,

Still waiting on my contact. Will follow up tomorrow.

Thanks,","6"
"737","Let’s do 5 EST.

Appreciate your flexibility","6"
"738","Done!","6"
"739","Hi Luciano - Can you remove this since we're meeting on Friday?

Thanks!","6"
"740","Hey Fin,

Can you help me schedule a 45 min call next week with Ari?

Thank you,","5"
"741","Hey Luciano,

I have done that step, and the web app is selected in my settings...not sure what isn't working.","6"
"742","Hey Brad,

Hope you had a great long weekend.

We are still unable to capture your calls at this point. But It's a quick fix; we just need to enable the Web App on GoToMeeting.

How to do it? See Here. :)","5"
"743","Hey Chris! No problem.

How about xxtime or xxtime ?","5"
"744","Luciano,

I’m so sorry for the late notice but I need to reschedule today. Anytime work for you tomorrow?

Apologies again for the last minute change.","5"
"745","Phil - yes. Will do.","6"
"746","Would it be possible to put those three topics into the context of “what does success look like” for PathFactory using Gong? I’d like to get a sense of the ROI we should expect to see, when and how.

Make sense?","5"
"747","Nick, thanks for the intro.

Benson, nice to e-meet you.

Are you available to connect on Friday?","5"
"748","Hi Phil,

Yes - good idea.

Based on what we discussed in our previous call, I suggest we cover the following:

How you can operationalize GongHow our customer success team will help youHow you can try Gong before committing to it

Anything else you or Bill would like to cover?","6"
"749","With a tight schedule, can we agree on an agenda for our upcoming call.

Thanks,","6"
"750","Hey Glenn,

Sounds good. Will make an introduction today.

Thanks,","6"
"751","Hey Mike,

We just released a promotional video highlighting our work with xxlink, the customer who's business looks very similar to PureWay. Check it out here.

By the way, I noticed the GrayLock contract has not been signed yet.

Are there still questions about it?","6"
"752","Hey Sri,

Hope you had a great long weekend filled with sports. Saw Ferrari came second in Monaco! Also, sorry about the Huston Rockets... close game.

Just asked my VP about discounting our xxmoney deal for 10 seats, and he said there is not much he can do given the size. If you can give me a number you are looking for and can sign today, I can go back to him with a more concrete ask.

What do we need?","5"
"753","Hey Casey,

Can we do 15 min earlier instead of 30 min?

Thanks,","5"
"754","Hey Mario,

Hope you had a nice long weekend.

Do we still have a shot a getting this across the line this month?

Thanks,","6"
"755","Hey Luciano,

Are you able to do our meeting 30 mins earlier?","6"
"756","Hi Luciano,

Thanks again for your time last week. I wanted to follow up to see if you could connect me with your xxlink contacts. We’d like to evaluate their solution and move toward implementing a dialer/engagement solution so we can then take next steps with Gong as well.

Thanks,","6"
"757","Hi Luciano,

Sorry for the last minute notice, but I have to ask that we reschedule.

Can we do Wednesday at xxtime or xxtime IST instead.

Ariel.","5"
"758","Hi Eileen,

Did that time work for you?","5"
"759","Hello,

We are all set for xxtime today.

Talk soon,

Tanner","5"
"760","Hi Sheila,

I wanted to circle back and see if this was relevant for your team?

Sisense partnered with Gong to increase transparency across the sales organizations and close the gap between top performers and the middle of the pack.","6"
"761","Hey Adrian,

That will work. I wanted to level with you, based on your previous exposure to Gong -

You understand the inherent value of our solution, what are your thoughts on discussing a contract before we start the trial and when it meets your expectations, we can roll you in an annual deal?

Smaller companies establish an immediate ROI with Gong and I want you in this rare group.

I could even see if we could incorporate an opt-out if you’re not satisfied.

Personally, I’d thoroughly enjoy the ability to partner with you.

What are your thoughts?","6"
"762","Hey Jeff,

I haven't heard back from you and wanted to make sure we were still on the same page.

Thanks,

Tanner","6"
"763","Hi TJ,

I wanted to circle back and while I was on your Linked In, I noticed you had an endorsement from Yair Areli (He speaks in one of our client testimonial videos).

One line that stuck out to me was ""strong relationship with his team and they followed his lead""

This sort of leadership ability can be cloned and shared amongst your team to ensure quota attainment is being hit consistently and you can provide the constant feedback on marquee deals that are needed - with Gong's help.

What are your thoughts on an intro conversation tomorrow to understand a little bit more about your sales process at Egnyte?

With your success in mind,

Tanner","6"
"764","Hi Eileen,

Thank for for the reply and good to hear from you.

That's exactly what will be covered in the call on Thursday - a walkthrough of Gong and how we are partnering with Sales Enablement Leaders, like yourself.

Also, to maximum the time we'll have on Thursday - what web-conferencing solution is your sales team using today? (Zoom, GoTo Meeting, etc.)

How does xxtime  look for you? I'll send over an invite once we pin down a time.

Thank you,","6"
"765","Thanks Tanner,

I have some time on Thursday afternoon- are you available to connect then? I haven't had a chance to catch up with Eric on your call the other day, do you mind giving me an update then on what you discussed and Gong then?

Thanks!","6"
"766","Sounds great!

Looking forward to an awesome event. I do want to note that (while both events will be fantastic) the SF event will be about twice as large. If Amit can only attend one -- I'd suggest the SF event.","6"
"767","Thanks for reaching out. Not interested in rekindling this conversation at the moment.","6"
"768","Correction: Tanner will be joining Jameson and Amit, our CEO, for the Seattle event.","6"
"769","Dan, Tanner is a Gong SDR and will be joining Becca (our Senior SDR Team Manager) and Jameson (VP Sales) for the Seattle MSP meetup.

Tanner will make himself available to help out before and during the event, as needed, to justify his entrance into the kingdom of ""NO SDRs ALLOWED"" :-)

I'll leave it to you two to take it from here.","5"
"770","Hi Travis,

I wanted to share a document we've put together which highlights several teams across LinkedIn who are currently using Gong, and where/how they've seen success so far as they leverage their teams' data in Gong.

I've also attached 2 best practice docs, one for managers and one for reps, which should be helpful to fill in any gaps around how you and your team can utilize the platform.

Not sure if you're the right person to ask about this. But i was trying to get a disco call recorded this AM. i put it in gong, and put it in my cal as well. I clicked on the bluejeans link, had them call my desk phone. and then i conferenced called in my clients, and i heard it say ""this call is being recorded"" but it isnt showing up on my portal...

I've had demos recorded already, so I know i'm connected- but not sure what im doing wrong.

it was for Bay Area Beverage at xxtime today.","6"

"849","Darryl,

Thanks for connecting over on Linkedin. I was reading up on CloudSense and noticed that one of the main mottos discussed is people wanting simplicity when it comes to buying, and I think it's safe to say in this day and age, buyers are intelligent, and resourceful.

When it comes to the sales world, there is an understanding that the parallel (sales world) is becoming more and more resourceful as well with the tools now available. Saleforce, Salesloft, Slack, etc.

The reason for my outreach is I work with VP's to boost revenue, and your teams resourcefulness by introducing our AI-recording platform, which, through analytical data, identifies what your top reps successes are, and mimics this behavior amongst CloudSense's sales team.

Would you have any availability next week to discuss your team at CloudSense?","5"

"858","Hi Asaf,

Thank you for the note and for the heads up. Congratulations on your upcoming role! I’ll be happy to work with you over there once you’re ramped and ready to reconnect.

As far as the pilot goes for HackerU, I think it could still be valuable to run the pilot even with your CEO leading the efforts. I’m actually setting up a pilot today with the CEO of a company leading a similar sized sales team. Since they’ll be stretched a bit with the upcoming changes, it could even be more valuable than before to surface insights to your CEO about sales team efforts and do it efficiently to save time.

I understand if we need to push the date/time but have you discussed Gong with your CEO and do you think they’d be open to it for the sales team still? I’d be happy to demo for them directly if needed before setting a pilot. Let me know your thoughts, thank you!","6"
"859","Hi Matthew,

Unfortunately I will have to cancel our meeting today and the planned Gong

setup.

I will be leaving the company at the end of August and currently there is

no one intended to take over my activities. The CEO will manage global

sales activities for the time being.

That being said, I will touch base with you\Gong in the next months as I

will be taking a leadership role at a cyber-security startup (product)

company and I believe the sales process there will be very much in the

need of a solution like Gong (SaaS like).

Thanks for the support so far.

Regards,","6"
"860","Hi Matt – still waiting to hear back from him","5"
"861","Thanks everyone - have a great weekend and I’ll speak with you all next week! I’ll send over a reminder the day before our pilot to turn on auto-recording in RingCentral. Speak soon.","6"
"862","yes please.","6"
"863","Hey Marlon & Eric,

Thank you both for your time today. Appreciate your help with diagnosing challenges and use-cases for us to go after. Right off the bat, here are two we can knockout easily: Make sure that your reps are doing the most with the opportunities they have by surfacing key insights into their process: how they're conducting discovery, driving next steps, getting wide in accounts, etc. and close more dealsHelp your new sales hires to start producing more and faster by automatically crowdsourcing and organizing training content (good and bad examples of calls and sales scenarios) to accelerate your on-boarding program.

Next steps: Reconnect early next week to discuss setting up a pilot for DocMatter. Pilots are initiated with an opt-out contract that provides a free two week trial of Gong. If the pilot is successful, the contract opts in at the end of two weeks. If not successful, you're able to opt-out with no cost to DocMatter within that two week period.

Have a great weekend and I'm looking forward to continuing our conversations. Thanks both!","6"
"864","Hey Marty,

Looking forward to connecting with you next week to show you the Gong platform! Here are some free times on my side, feel free to click one to auto-schedule:

xxmixmax","5"
"865","That's a good approach and we can go over how to set that up on the pilot call. Should I add everyone here to the calendar invite?","6"
"866","My plan was to offer it to all, but approach our top 10 or so callers, plus kent mitchell and a few others directly.","5"
"867","If I can make a recommendation, I'd recommend having as many people on the pilot as possible. It's best to get a wide range between top, middle and bottom performers so you can see the impact of having access to their calls to coach and train reps in the middle/bottom of the pack. It'll also make sure you get the most calls possible to test for two weeks.","5"
"868","Ok, I think James would like to move forward the the pilot.

The only question is who will we be using as testers?

James, did you have any in particular? I'm thinking we use those who are in the middle of the pack, like Tim Norkol, Ben Mandel, Garret Blair, Monjid Aldiyyat, Matthew Rulloda, Fritz Jacobs, Derrick Reedy, Giovanni Corona, Dante Giacomini, Robert Dau, Kyle Nuss, Andrew Eckstein, Devin Rocha, Jake Edwards, Joshua Ballesteros, Ganga Balebail, John Alanis, Randell Silva","6"
"869","Just in case next Thursday works, I wanted to send over my free times before they get taken. Feel free to click one of the times that works and it'll auto-schedule on our calendars. Before the pilot, please ensure that RingCentral Dialer is adjusted to auto-record your calls. This can be done by your RingCentral administrator - let me know if I can provide any documentation to help with this. Thanks both!

xxmixmax","5"
"870","Hey Shyler and Marty, I just accepted the meeting and look forward to connecting next week.

I have included Matt Boehm here to set up the time with Marty to talk about Gong for Clari.

Talk soon.","6"
"871","Hey Margarita,

Glad to discuss over the phone but the time investment is very minimal during a pilot. We'd do one 30 minute discussion to setup the pilot and your success criteria, another 30 minute call to train the management team and a final 30 minute call to train the reps on how they can use Gong to be more successful.

After those calls, we'd do a mid-pilot check in at the end of the first week and, pending how the pilot is tracking, discuss more of the financials, final user counts, etc. to get you up and running following the pilot. If the pilot is not successful, you can discontinue usage.","5"

"875","Hi Matthew,

How much work would be involved on NAI's side for this pilot? I'm curious of the time that it will take up for our team.

If you'd like to setup a call to discuss specifics regarding the pilot, that's fine also.","5"
"876","Margarita, can you please check in with the team? If they cannot agree or respond either way, we will schedule a call to start the pilot on Thursday of next week. It is optional for our sales people, Without cost, and shows service promise to me, so I see no issue.","5"
"877","Hey James,

I know that we were targeting today for either some additional questions or to get something on the calendar to kick off a pilot for your team so I wanted to follow up. Should we find time next week to start the pilot? Let me know if you have any questions I can answer prior to setting that up. Thank you!","5"
"878","Gotcha. Thanks.","6"
"879","Definitely. We can't guarantee roadmaps but our team has historically been on point and we're targeting end of Q3/beginning of Q4 for it to be released at this point.","5"
"880","Feeling good on 2019 for that?","6"
"881","Ahh OK. We can still record and analyze their calls just fine but won't be able to push data to a custom object for the time being.","6"
"882","We have a partnership team that work out of a custom object.","6"
"883","Hey Adrien,

Right now we can push back information to Opportunities, Leads and Accounts: both standard fields and custom fields.

Custom objects are coming and are scheduled to be released before EOY. What would be the use case for you? Maybe there's another way we can get what you need.","6"
"884","Hi, Matthew.

Thanks for your email.

One quick question: can we map to custom Objects, or only to Opps and Leads?

Best regards,","5"
"885","Thanks Justin, I appreciate it. Hope you have a great weekend as well and speak soon!","6"
"886","Hey Mark,

Happy Friday! I wanted to check in to see if you've heard anything back from your Hubspot contractor? Wanted to see if we could turn or Tuesday discussion into a set up cal with Ryanl if possible. Thanks!","6"
"887","Thank you Matt. I sent to our head of data, Shai in TLV. I keep you posted on what I hear from him.

Have a great weekend!","6"
"888","Hey Jonathan,

I wanted to follow up on the contract to see if you've had a moment to check it out. If so, do you think it will be possible to sign today? Just want to ensure we can start the pilot on Monday. If it's easier, we can also get things signed on our upcoming call. Benefit of signing today would be to ensure we have the full 30 minutes dedicated to the pilot setup. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer those for you. Speak soon!","5"
"889","So when I turn ""Lock to Element"" on -- it actually makes the Tab disappear completely.","5"

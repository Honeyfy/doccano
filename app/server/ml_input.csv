"1","White-haired Dr. Jekyll has secretly locked himself in his laboratory administering himself with a vial of formula. He slumps into his chair with his head on his chest. Slowly   as the drug takes effect   a dark-haired   taloned beast now appears in the chair. After repeated use   Jekyll's evil alter ego emerges at will   causing Jekyll to murder his sweetheart's father. The evil personality scuttles back to the laboratory only to discover that the antidote is finished and that he will be as Mr. Hyde forever. A burly policeman breaks down Jekyll's door to find that the kindly doctor is dead after taking poison.","3"
"2","Dr. Henry Jekyll (King Baggot) sends a note to his fiancée   Alice (Jane Gail)   and her father (Matt B. Snyder) to say that instead of accompanying them to the opera   he must give more time to his charity patients. At Jekyll’s practice   his friends Dr. Lanyon (Howard Crampton) and Utterson (William Sorrel)   a lawyer   ridicule him for what they consider his dangerous research. Alice and her father also visit Jekyll’s rooms   but although apologetic   the doctor insists on devoting his time to his patients. That night   however   Jekyll undertakes a dangerous experiment   swallowing a drug intended to releases his evil self. His body convulses   and he transforms into a hunched   twisted figure. The strange creature emerges from Jekyll’s room   bearing a note in Jekyll’s handwriting that orders the household staff to treat the stranger – “Mr Hyde” – as himself. Hyde then slips out into the night   terrorising the patrons of a nearby tavern before finding himself lodgings. From these rooms he begins a career of evil   until one night he attacks and injures a crippled child. Outraged witnesses corner Hyde and force him to agree to compensate the boy. Hyde reluctantly leads one man back to Jekyll’s house and gives him money. During this passage of events   a worried Dr. Utterson sees Hyde entering Jekyll’s house. Inside   Hyde takes a potion that transforms him back to Jekyll. The doctor swears that he will abandon his experiments and never tempt fate again; but that night   without taking the drug   he turns spontaneously into Hyde.","3"
"3","Henry Jekyll (John Barrymore) is a doctor of medicine   an idealist   and philanthropist. When he is not treating the poor in his free clinic   he is in his laboratory experimenting. Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst)   the father of his fiancée   Millicent (Martha Mansfield)   is piqued by Dr. Jekyll. No man could be as good as he looks   Carew says. Following dinner one night   Carew taunts Dr. Jekyll in front of their friends   Edward Enfield (Cecil Clovelly)   Dr. Lanyon (Charles Lane) and Utterson (J. Malcolm Dunn) proclaiming In devoting yourself to others   Jekyll   aren't you neglecting the development of your own life? Isn't it by serving others that one develops oneself? Jekyll replies. Which self? Carew retorts. Man has two - as he has two hands. Because I use my right hand   should I never use my left? Your really strong man fears nothing. It is the weak one who is afraid of experience. A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. With your youth   you should live - as I have lived. I have memories. What will you have at my age? And thus the seed is sown   and Jekyll begins his experiments. As he observes   Wouldn't it be marvellous if the two natures in man could be separated - housed in different bodies? Think what it would mean to yield to every evil impulse   yet leave the soul untouched! Finally   Jekyll develops a potion that turns him into a hideously evil creature that he calls Edward Hyde. As this creature   he is not recognizable as Dr. Jekyll   and   so   to facilitate the comings and goings of Hyde   he tells his servant   Poole (George Stevens)   that Hyde is to have full authority and liberty about the house. Jekyll thus begins to live his double life. Hyde sets up a room in one of the seediest parts of London. He brings in a girl from the dance hall   Gina (Nita Naldi)   to live with him there and frequents opium dens   dance halls   and bars - any place that satisfies his evil desires. Although Jekyll has developed a potion that will also return him to his original appearance and character as Dr. Jekyll   each time he takes the potion to become Edward Hyde   he worsens. He not only looks more evil   he becomes more evil   as well. Millicent Carew is worried about the absence of her fiancé   so Sir George goes to call on Jekyll to see what is the matter. Although Jekyll is not home when he calls   Sir George encounters Hyde in the street just as he knocks a small boy to the ground injuring him. To make recompense for his actions   he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy's father. Carew notices that the check has been signed by Dr. Jekyll. He confronts Poole who tells him the story of Edward Hyde. In the meantime   Hyde/Jekyll has returned to the lab and   after drinking the potion   returns to his original self. Sir George finds him in the lab and demands to know his relationship with a vile thing like Hyde? What right have you to question me - you who first tempted me? says Jekyll. Sir George angrily retorts that unless Jekyll is forthcoming with an explanation   he must object to his marriage to Millicent. This angers Jekyll to the point that he suddenly becomes Hyde   right in front of Sir George's eyes   without benefit of the potion. Sir George runs into the courtyard where Hyde catches him and clubs him to death with his walking stick. Hyde runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence that may link him to Jekyll. He eludes the police by only minutes and returns to his lab where he is able to drink the potion that restores him as Jekyll. In the ensuing days   as Millicent grieves   Jekyll is tortured by his misdeeds. Soon   the drug needed to make the potion that will return him as Dr. Jekyll is depleted and cannot be found in all of London. Jekyll stays locked up in his lab fearing he may become Hyde at any moment. Millicent finally goes to see him   but just as she is about to enter the lab   he begins to transform into Hyde. Jekyll consumes the poison in the ring he took from the Italian dancer before he opens the door   fully transformed into Hyde. He lets her in   locks the door and grabs her in his arms. Suddenly   he starts convulsing. Millicent runs from the lab and when Lanyon comes in   he finds Hyde sitting in a chair   having just died   and his appearance returned to that of Dr. Jekyll. He discerns that Jekyll committed suicide   and calls the others (Poole   Utterson and Millicent) in   but declares to them that Hyde has killed Dr. Jekyll. In the final shot   Millicent is grieving next to the body of Dr. Jekyll.","3"

"5","The film opens with the debut of the new season at the Paris Opera House   with a production of Gounod's Faust. Comte Philippe de Chagny (John St. Polis) and his brother   the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny (Norman Kerry) are in attendance. Raoul attends only in the hope of hearing his sweetheart Christine Daaé (Mary Philbin) sing. Christine has made a sudden rise from the chorus to understudy of Mme. Carlotta   the prima donna. Raoul visits her in her dressing room during the performance   and makes his intentions known that he wishes for Christine to resign and marry him. Christine refuses to let their relationship get in the way of her career. At the height of the most prosperous season in the Opera's history   the management suddenly resign. As they leave   they tell the new managers of the Opera Ghost   a phantom who asks for opera box #5   among other things. The new managers laugh it off as a joke   but the old management leaves troubled. After the performance   the ballerinas are disturbed by the sight of a mysterious man in a fez (Arthur Edmund Carewe)   who dwells in the cellars. Arguing whether or not he is the Phantom   they decide to ask Joseph Buquet   a stagehand who has actually seen the ghost's face. Buquet describes a ghastly sight of a living skeleton to the girls   who are then startled by a shadow cast on the wall. The antics of stagehand Florine Papillon (Snitz Edwards) do not amuse Joseph's brother   Simon (Gibson Gowland)   who chases him off. Meanwhile   Mme. Carlotta (Virginia Pearson)   the prima donna of the Paris Grand Opera   barges into the managers' office enraged. She has received a letter from The Phantom   demanding that Christine sing the role of Marguerite the following night   threatening dire consequences if his demands are not met. Christine is in her dressing room at that moment   speaking to a phantom voice (which the audience sees as a shadow on a wall behind the dressing room.) The voice warns her that she will take Carlotta's place on Wednesday and that she is to think only of her career and her master. The following day   in a garden near the Opera House   Raoul meets Christine and asks her to reconsider his offer. Christine admits that she has been tutored by a divine voice   the Spirit of Music   and that it is now impossible to stop her career. Raoul tells her that he thinks someone is playing a joke on her   and she storms off in anger. Wednesday evening   Carlotta is ill and Christine takes her place in the opera. During the performance   the managers go to Box 5 to see exactly who has taken it. The keeper of the box does not know who it is   as she has never seen his face. The two managers enter the box and are startled to see a shadowy figure seated there. They run out of the box and compose themselves   but when they enter the box again   the person is gone. In her next performance   Christine reaches her triumph during the finale and receives a standing ovation from the audience. When Raoul visits her in her dressing room   she pretends not to recognize him   because unbeknownst to those in the room   the phantom voice is present. Meanwhile   Simon Buquet finds the body of his brother   Joseph   hanging by the strangler's noose and vows vengeance. Raoul spends the evening outside her door   and after the others have left   just as he is about to enter   he hears the voice within the room. He overhears the voice make his intentions to Christine: Soon   Christine   this spirit will take form and will demand your love! When Christine leaves her room alone   Raoul breaks in to find it empty. Carlotta receives another discordant note from the Phantom. Once again   it demands that she take ill and let Christine have her part. The managers also get a note   reiterating that if Christine does not sing   they will present Faust in a house with a curse on it. The following evening   despite the Phantom's warnings   a defiant Carlotta appears as Marguerite. At first   the performance goes well   but soon the Phantom's curse takes its effect   backstage   causing the great crystal chandelier to fall down onto the audience. Christine runs to her dressing room and is entranced by a mysterious voice through a secret door behind the mirror   descending   in a dream-like sequence   semi-conscious on horseback by a winding staircase into the lower depths of the Opera. She is then taken by gondola over a subterranean lake by the masked Phantom into his lair. The Phantom introduces himself as Erik and declares his love; Christine faints   so Erik carries her to a suite fabricated for her comfort. The next day   when she awakens   she finds a note from Erik telling her that she is free to come and go as she pleases   but that she must never look behind his mask. In the next room   the Phantom is playing his composition   Don Juan Triumphant. Christine's curiosity gets the better of her   and she sneaks up behind the Phantom and tears off his mask   revealing his hideously deformed face. Enraged   the Phantom makes his plans to hold her prisoner known. In an attempt to plead to him   he excuses her to visit her world one last time   with the condition that she never sees her lover again. Released from the underground dungeon   Christine makes a rendezvous at the annual masked-ball   which is graced with the Phantom in the guise of the 'Red-Death' from the Edgar Allan Poe short story of the same name. Raoul finds Christine and they flee to the roof of the Opera House   where she tells him everything that followed the chandelier crash. However   an unseen jealous Phantom perching on the statue of Apollo overhears them. Raoul plans to whisk Christine safely away to London following the next performance. As they leave the roof   the mysterious man with the fez approaches them. Aware that the Phantom is waiting downstairs   he leads Christine and Raoul to another exit. The following evening   Raoul meets Christine in her dressing room. She has heard the voice of the Phantom   who has revealed that he knows their plans. Raoul has arranged for a carriage and reassures her nothing will go wrong. During the performance   the Phantom kidnaps Christine off the stage during a blackout. Raoul rushes to Christine's dressing room   and meets the man in the fez   who reveals himself to be Inspector Ledoux   a secret policeman who has been studying Erik's moves as the Phantom since he escaped as a prisoner from Devil's Island. Ledoux reveals the secret door in Christine's room and the two men enter the catacombs of the Opera House in an attempt to rescue Christine. Instead   they fall into the Phantom's dungeon   a torture room of his design. Philippe has also found his way into the catacombs looking for his brother   and a clanging alarm alerts the Phantom to his presence in a canoe on the lake. Phillipe is drowned by Erik   who returns to find the two men in the torture chamber. Turning a switch   the Phantom subjects the two prisoners to intense heat; the two manage to escape the chamber by opening a door in the floor as they are about to perish. In the chamber below   the Phantom shuts a gate   locking them in with barrels full of gunpowder. The Phantom gives Christine a choice of two levers: one shaped like a scorpion and the other like a grasshopper. One of them will save Raoul's life   but at the cost of Christine marrying Erik   while the other will blow up the barrels in the chamber Raoul and Ledoux are trapped in   in effect destroying the Opera House and killing them all. Christine picks the scorpion   but it is a trick by the Phantom to save Raoul and Ledoux from being killed by drowning them. Christine begs the Phantom to save Raoul   promising him anything in return   even becoming his wife. At the last second   the Phantom opens a trapdoor in his floor through which Raoul and Ledoux are saved. A mob   led by Simon   infiltrates the Phantom's lair. As the clanging alarm sounds and the mob approaches   the Phantom attempts to flee with Christine in the carriage meant for Raoul and Christine. While Raoul saves Christine   the Phantom is pursued and killed by a mob   who throw him into the River Seine to finally drown. In a brief epilogue   Raoul and Christine are shown on their honeymoon in Viroflay.","4"

Margaret emerges from her trance and is reunited with her true love. Porhoet finds the page with the formula. He burns it and sets the laboratory afire as well.","3"

"12","On her arrival in Haiti   Madeleine Short (Madge Bellamy) reunites with her fiancé Neil Parker (John Harron)   with imminent plans to be married. On the voyage   she met Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer)   a wealthy planter who convinced her to have the marriage ceremony at his plantation house. Beaumont has fallen in love with Madelaine   and plans to get Neil out of the way by giving him a job in New York as his agent. On the way to Beaumont's house   the couple's carriage passes Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi)   an evil voodoo master   leading a group of zombies.

After arriving at the house   and meeting Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn)   who is to perform the ceremony   the couple is shown to their rooms   and Beaumont goes off in a cart driven by a zombie to meet Legendre at Legendre's sugarcane mill   operated entirely by zombies. Beaumont solicits Legendre's supernatural assistance in getting Madeleine to marry him. Legendre states that the only way is to transform Madeleine into a zombie with a potion. Beaumont protests that he will find another way   but Legendre insists that the potion is the only way   and makes him he take it with him. The next day   as Beaumont is leading Madeleine to the altar   he tries to convince her not to go through with the wedding   but she insists. He asks for one final kiss   and gives her a rose with the potion on it. She kisses the flower and puts it into her bouquet.

Hearing the raving Neil approach   they remove Madeleine's casket from the tomb. Finding it empty   Neil seeks assistance from Dr. Bruner   who explains to him about the possible existence of zombies. In Legendre's cliffside castle   Madeleine has been revived as a zombie   and Beaumont listens to her play the piano   her eyes lifeless. He gives her jewelry   but she does not respond. Beaumont now regrets having transformed her into a zombie. He begs Legendre to return her to life   but he refuses   and demonstrates his mental control over her by wordlessly sending her away.

"13","Big-game hunter and wealthy zoologist Eric Gorman (Lionel Atwill) is an insanely jealous husband who uses his animal knowledge to dispose of his impulsive wife’s lovers. The film opens in an Indian jungle with Gorman using a needle and thread to sew a colleague’s mouth closed after having discovered that he had kissed his wife   and then he seals the man’s fate by abandoning him in the jungle with the wild beasts. Gorman later pretends to be surprised at hearing that the man had been eaten by tigers. Both Gorman and his wife Evelyn (Kathleen Burke) then return to America aboard a ship packed with captured animals he intends to add to his collection at a major zoo. On the ship   Evelyn starts to develop promiscuous relations with Roger Hewitt (John Lodge)   which she makes little effort to hide from her husband. Naturally   the murderously jealous Gorman takes notice. So once back in the States   he begins to plot a way to get rid of Hewitt. The zoo is beginning to run into financial trouble and the new press agent   Peter Yates (Charles Ruggles)   a man terrified of most of the zoo’s animals and considered to be an alcoholic   decides to host a fundraising dinner. Gorman takes this as a perfect opportunity to dispense his vengeance by poisoning Hewitt with mamba venom. He had obtained the poison after asking the zoo’s laboratory doctor   Jack Woodford (Randolph Scott)   to work on finding an antitoxin for the snake’s fatal bite. When Hewitt unexpectedly dies at the fundraising dinner   Evelyn accuses her husband of being the murderer. Outraged   Gorman attacks her   but she is able to escape into his office where she finds a mechanical mamba head seeping with real mamba poison in his desk. She now knows for a fact that he killed Hewitt and takes the snake head with the intention to find Dr. Woodford. However   Gorman finds her and prevents her from revealing his crime by throwing her to the alligators   where she is torn to shreds. The following day a group of children who sneak into the zoo discover tattered remains of Evelyn’s dress. Dr. Woodford then becomes suspicious and accuses Gorman of murdering both his wife and Rodger Hewitt. Gorman disposes of Dr. Woodford by attacking him with the mechanical snake head just as he had done to Hewitt. The doctor's assistant Jerry (Gail Patrick) gives Woodford a shot of the antitoxin he had created for the mamba poison in time to save his life. She also realizes that Gorman is responsible for the apparent mamba attack when he tries to stop her   and has the zoo's alarms set off. A police chase thus ensues as Gorman is pursued through the zoo. Gorman releases big cats from the carnivore house in the hopes of distracting the police   but it backfires and a lion chases Gorman into the cage of a boa constrictor   who then slowly kills and devours him. In the epilogue   Jerry visits a convalescing Dr. Woodford in the hospital. The stress   meanwhile   has caused Yates to fall off the wagon   and he is seen fearlessly meandering through the zoo   even swatting on the nose a still free lion that had been stalking him.",""
"14","Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) is a sculptor who operates a wax museum in 1921 London. He gives a private tour to a friend   Dr. Rasmussen (Holmes Herbert) and an investor   Mr. Galatalin (Claude King) showing them sculptures of Joan of Arc   Voltaire   and his favorite   Marie Antoinette. Formerly a stone sculptor who did wax modeling as a hobby   he explains he turned to wax sculpting completely because he felt more satisfied that he could reproduce the warmth   flesh   and blood of life far better in wax than in cold stone. Mr. Galatalin   impressed by his sculptures   offers to submit Igor's work to the Royal Academy after he returns from a trip to Egypt. Unfortunately business at the museum is failing due to people's attraction to the macabre (a nearby wax museum caters to that). Igor's partner Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell) proposes to burn the museum down for the insurance money of £10  000. Igor will not allow such a travesty   but Worth starts a fire anyway. Igor tries to stop him and he and Worth get into a fight. As they fight   wax masterworks are melting in the flames. Worth knocks Igor unconscious   leaving the sculptor to die in the fire. Igor survives   however   and reemerges in 1933   12 years later   in New York City   reopening a new wax museum. His hands and legs have been badly crippled in the fire and he must rely on assistants to create his new sculptures. Meanwhile   spunky reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell)   on the verge of being fired for not bringing in any worthwhile news   is sent out by her impatient editor   Jim (Frank McHugh)   to investigate the suicide of a model named Joan Gale (Monica Bannister). During this time   a hideous monster steals the body of Joan Gale from the morgue. When investigators find that her body has been stolen   they suspect murder. The finger initially points to George Winton (Gavin Gordon)   son of a powerful industrialist   but after visiting him in jail   Florence thinks differently. Florence's roommate is Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray)   whose fiancé Ralph (Allen Vincent) works at Igor's new wax museum. While visiting the museum   Florence notices an uncanny resemblance between a wax figure of Joan of Arc and the dead model. At the same time   Igor spots Charlotte and remarks on her resemblance to his sculpture of Marie Antoinette. Igor employs a couple of shady characters: Professor Darcy (Arthur Edmund Carewe)   a drug addict   and Hugo (Matthew Betz)   a deaf-mute. Darcy also works for Joe Worth   now a bootlegger in the city   among whose customers is none other than Winton. While investigating an old house where Worth keeps his bootlegged alcohol   Florence discovers a monster connected with the museum   but cannot prove any connection with the disappearance of Joan Gale's body. Darcy is seen running from the house and is caught by the police. When brought to the station   he eventually breaks down and admits that Igor is in fact the killer and that he has been murdering people (including a missing judge whose watch was found on Darcy's person)   stealing their bodies   and dipping them in wax to create lifelike sculptures. Charlotte   visiting Ralph at the museum   is trapped there by Igor   who it is revealed can still walk. When Charlotte tries to get away   she pounds away at his face   breaking a wax mask that he has made of himself   to reveal that he had been horribly disfigured. He also shows her the dead body of Joe Worth   whom Darcy had been tracking down for him for some time. When she faints   he straps her onto a table   intending to douse her with molten wax and make her his lost Marie Antoinette sculpture. Florence leads the police to the museum just in time: for a man supposedly crippled by fire   Igor moves with surprising speed and agility   successfully fighting off the police   but is finally gunned down. He falls into a giant vat of wax which was intended for Charlotte. Charlotte is saved when Ralph moves away the table she is strapped to from where the wax is about to pour onto her. When Florence reports her story to her editor   Jim   he proposes to her. Having to choose between money (Winton) and happiness (Jim)   she picks the latter.",""

The tale closely parallels that of the original film   except that Kharis steals the sacred tana leaves in the hope of restoring life to the dead Princess Ananka. His penalty upon being discovered is to be buried alive   without a tongue   and the tana leaves are buried with him. The leaves are the secret to Kharis' continued existence.
